# MOVIE DATABASE
## SUMMARY
  Using data from three sources, this project combines the data sources, cleans them up and then adds it to a PostgreSQL datagbase to be available for future analysis
### BACKGROUND
Using a combination of Pandas, Python and the ETL process, we were able to create a function that cleaned Wikipedia and Kaggle data about movies.  Once these databases were cleaned, we added them to an SQL database which now has two tables with a primary common key so the inforamtion ca be combined.  Since this process was successful, this new project is now going to add in a third database from MovieLens which will make the analytical process more robust.
